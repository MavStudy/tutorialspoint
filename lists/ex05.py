Python Specific Data Structures: List, Tuple, Dictionary

These data structures are specific to python language, and they give greater
flexibility in storing different types of data and faster processing in python
environment.

List âˆ’ It is similar to array with the exception that the data elements
can be of different data types. You can have both numeric and string data
in a python list.

    Basic List Operations

    Lists respond to the + and * operators much like strings; they mean
    concatenation and repetition here too, except that the result is a new
    list, not a string.

    In fact, lists respond to all of the general sequence operations we used
    on strings in the prior chapter.
