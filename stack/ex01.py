Python-Stack

In the english dictionary the word stack means arranging objects on over
another. It is the same way memory is allocated in this data structure. It
stores the data elements in a similar fashion as a bunch of plates are stored
one above another in the kitchen. So stack data strcuture allows operations at
one end wich can be called top of the stack.We can add elements or remove
elements only form this en dof the stack.

In a stack the element inserted last in sequence will come out first as we can
remove only from the top of the stack. Such feature is known as
Last in First Out(LIFO) feature. The operations of adding and removing the
elements is known as PUSH and POP. In the following program we implement it as
add and remove functions. We declare an empty list and use append() and
pop() methods to add and remove the data elements.
